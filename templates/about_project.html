    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to our Wine Quality Prediction project! We're using smart computer techniques to guess how good a wine might be. We collected lots of information about different wines from a place called Kaggle. Then, we looked at this info really closely, figuring out the important bits that help predict wine quality.
After that, we used some super cool math tricks to create a smart program (we call it a model) that can predict wine quality accurately. Now, anyone can use our project to quickly find out if a wine is awesome or just okay. It's like having a personal wine quality expert at your fingertips! Cheers to predicting great wines! üç∑ü§ñ   </p>
